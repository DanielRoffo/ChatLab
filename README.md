### Description:
**Hi! Welcome to ChatLab!**
**ChatLab is a chat web application where you can create you own account and chat with friends whenever whatsapp, instagram, facebook or any other chat application shuts down!**
**Before you can start chatting, you will need to create an account. In order to create an account you will need an email address, an account name and a password that will be securely stored in our database. An email will be sent to your mailbox where you will receive your confirmation code to create your account!**
**Once the account is created the user will be able to change all his data and profile picture in the "account" section. To add friends you must have the user name and id number of the friend in the "account" section, and enter the data in the "Add Contact" section. Once added you will be ready to chat in the "My Chat" section!**
**In case you do not have an account created, you will only have access to the ChatLab home page, a short description of me and the registration and login area. Don't forget to try the dark mode that the site offers!**

### Technology used:
***Flask**
***SQL**
***HTML**
***CSS**
***Bootstrap**
***JavaScript**
***Pusher**
***PhpMyAdmin**
***jQuery**

### Explanation of the inner workings of the app:
**Inside app.py is all the inner workings of the app. At the top you can find all the app's configurations, and then you can find each one of the app's pages. In the templates folder you can find all the HTML used for the pages. In static are the CSS files and all the photos used in the app.**
**To store user information I use PhpMyAdmin, a free database. Where I could securely store all passwords, emails, user names, conversations and much more.**

### features I would like to add in the future!
**-Dark mode must be added once the session is logged in**
**-Although the "Global Chat" function works, it is disabled for the moment. It needs to be improved visually, but due to lack of time I preferred to leave it disabled and worry about the main function of the application, "My Chat"!**
**-It still has some minor bugs that need to be corrected, but nothing serious enough to prevent the site from working properly.**
**-I would like to buy a domain for the site and be able to host it permanently on the internet!**
**-I would like to change the database as I had some problems using it and it is not very reliable. For the moment I will keep this one as it serves its purpose.**
